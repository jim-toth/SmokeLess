# SmokeLess

SmokeLess is a mobile application to aid users in their journey to smoke less tobacco or to become totally tobacco free.  Currently Android only.

## Development Requirements
- Node 10
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

## Dependencies
- [React Native 60](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.60)

## Install
- `npm i`

## Run
1. `npm run android` will attempt to start the app on a configured emulator device or a physical device connected via USB with "USB Debugging" enabled on the phone.
2. Code!  Shake your phone for a debug menu that offers a few options such as hot reloading and opening up a debugger window in your browser (access to console.log, etc.)

## Build
Probably won't need to do this but just in case there are a couple npm scripts to aid building.  This section will expand in the future
- `npm run build:android:staging`
- `npm run build:android:production`

## Contributing
